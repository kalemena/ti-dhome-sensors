= ti-dhome-sensors

Sensors library.

This is DIY Sensor unit handler used to capture plenty of metrics and send them over the air to central server.

NOTE: This project is part of a wider link:https://github.com/kalemena/ti-dhome[TiDhome Home Automation] project.

The initial model units are heavily inspired from the venerable JeeLab Room node.

== Usage

Sensors are placed in each room and are each monitoring few of below metrics:

* Temparature (1 or more sensor per unit)
* Humidity
* Pressure
* Light
* Move
* TODO: plant humidity
* TODO: gaz
* TODO: pH-meter / CO2

Eventualy, the various measure serve to:

* control electric heaters
* control VMC (home motorized air flow controler)
* alarm on various actions (plants, etc)
* etc

= Hardware

*Central board:*

* JeeLink (full enclosure, see JeeLab web site)

Base board for *sensors model*:

* model 1 : RFM12B (868Mhz) JeeNode (arduino compatible + radio, see JeeLab web site)
* model 2 : RFM69CW (868Mhz) Arduino pro mini 3.3v or clone

*Batteries:* 3xAA or 1xAA+3.3v step-up, or other

*Sensors* (1+ per board):

* Temperature: DS18B20 (waterproof or not)
* Temparature + Humidity: SHT11, DHT22, HTU21
* Pressure: BMP85
* Light: standard LDR
* Move: TBD
* Plant humidity: TBD
* Gaz: TBD
* pH-meter / CO2: TBD

= Models

== Model 1

link:model-1[Model 1] was done in 2010, based entirely on JeeLab work.

== Model 2

link:model-2[Model 2] was done in 2015, with little evolution from model 1.
