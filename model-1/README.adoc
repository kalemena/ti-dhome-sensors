= Description

This sensor was done in 2010, based entirely on JeeLab work.

The sensors are RFM12B 868Mhz radio transceivers.

One central transceiver receives all measures from all remote sensors.  

= Hardware

Receiver listens on USB tty port:

Plenty emmiter send data using below as base board.

Plenty sensors as seen on main page.

Wiring sensors is described at https://github.com/kalemena/arduino-res[arduino-res]

= Implementation

== How-To - central receiver node

* Open sketch from folder 'src/sketches/sensor_rx_unit/' into Arduino IDE
* Upload sketch to radio-enabled device
* Connect receiver node to USB and find which usb resource connected

[source,bash]
----
$ lsusb
$ dmesg
----

* Allow user access to resource and set speed

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 57600
$ sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0
$ cat /dev/ttyUSB0
----

* Edit test script to point to USB devices or point Node-Red to correct USB device.


== How-To - remote sensor nodes

* Open sketch from folder 'src/sketches/sensor_trx_unit/' into Arduino IDE

* Modify sketch to match sensor devices plugged onto the arduino (ensure pins are correct)

* Upload sketch to radio-enabled device

* ... let it submit metrics over the air ...

== Tests

A small javascript code is done to grab on tty USB port and submit to mqtt queue.

Go to folder 'src/js/' and run below commands:

[source,bash]
----
$ npm install serialport
$ npm install mqtt
$ node pub-jeenodes.js
----
